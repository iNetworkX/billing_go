# Task 4 Completion: command_handler.go Enhancement

## Overview
Task 4 has been successfully completed, enhancing the `show-users` command to display active connections with their last activity time.

## Changes Made
- **File**: `bhandler/command_handler.go`
- **Lines**: 68-85 (new code added)
- **Function**: `showUsers`

## Implementation Details
Added a new "active connections" section that displays:
- Username of each active connection
- IP address (in parentheses)
- Last activity timestamp in format: "2006-01-02 15:04:05"
- Shows "empty" if no active connections exist

## Command Output Structure
The `./billing show-users` command now displays four sections:
1. **login users**: Users who have authenticated but not entered game
2. **online users**: Users currently in the game
3. **IP counters**: Connection count per IP address
4. **active connections**: All connections with last activity time

## Code Quality
- Successfully compiled with `make`
- Passed `go fmt` formatting
- Passed `go vet` static analysis
- Follows existing code patterns and conventions

## Integration Points
- Uses `HandlerResource.ActiveConnections` map
- Works with health check system (Task 3) for timestamp maintenance
- No breaking changes - only extends existing functionality

## Status
All 6 tasks for IP-based player limiting are now complete. The system provides comprehensive connection monitoring and automatic cleanup capabilities.
