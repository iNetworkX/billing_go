# IP-based Player Limiting - Complete Implementation

## Project Status: ✅ FULLY COMPLETED

All 7 planned tasks for migrating from MAC-based to IP-based player limiting have been successfully completed.

## Completed Tasks Overview

1. **Task 1: mark_online.go** - Updated player tracking from MAC to IP addresses
2. **Task 2: logout_handler.go** - Implemented proper cleanup with memory leak prevention
3. **Task 3: health_check.go** - Added automatic stale connection detection and cleanup
4. **Task 4: command_handler.go** - Enhanced show-users command with 4 sections
5. **Task 5: Initialize Maps** - Properly initialized IPCounters and ActiveConnections
6. **Task 6: Update References** - Updated all MAC references to IP throughout codebase
7. **Task 7: Documentation** - Updated TODO.md and CLAUDE.md with complete summaries

## Key Implementation Details

### New Data Structures
- `IPCounters`: map[string]int - Tracks connections per IP
- `ActiveConnections`: map[string]*ConnectionInfo - Tracks connection health
- `ConnectionInfo`: Struct with Username, IP, and LastActivity timestamp

### Configuration Changes
```yaml
# Required change
ip_max_client_count: 3  # was: pc_max_client_count

# Optional addition  
connection_timeout: 300  # seconds (0 to disable health checks)
```

### Health Check System
- Runs every timeout/2 seconds
- Detects stale connections automatically
- Cleans up all data structures properly
- Prevents memory leaks

### Enhanced Monitoring
The `show-users` command now displays:
1. Login users (authenticated but not in game)
2. Online users (currently in game)
3. IP counters (connections per IP)
4. Active connections (with last activity times)

## Files Modified

### Core Files
- `bhandler/mark_online.go` - IP tracking logic
- `bhandler/logout_handler.go` - Cleanup logic
- `services/billing/health_check.go` - New health monitoring
- `bhandler/command_handler.go` - Enhanced monitoring
- `services/billing/load_handlers.go` - Map initialization
- `common/server_config.go` - Configuration structure
- `services/load_server_config.go` - Default values

### Handler Updates
All 7 handlers calling markOnline were updated:
- enter_game_handler.go
- cost_log_handler.go
- keep_handler.go
- prize_card_handler.go
- prize_fetch_handler.go
- prize_handler.go
- query_point_handler.go

## Production Ready Features

1. **Automatic Cleanup** - No manual intervention needed
2. **Memory Leak Prevention** - Proper map entry removal
3. **Backward Compatible** - Game clients work unchanged
4. **Comprehensive Logging** - Structured logs for monitoring
5. **Configurable Limits** - Adjustable per deployment

## Testing Checklist
- ✅ Multiple connections from same IP
- ✅ Abrupt disconnection handling
- ✅ Normal logout flow
- ✅ Counter accuracy under load
- ✅ Health check functionality

## Documentation Status
- ✅ TODO.md - Complete with all task summaries
- ✅ CLAUDE.md - Updated with implementation details
- ✅ Configuration examples provided
- ✅ Production deployment guide included

The billing_go server is now fully migrated to IP-based player limiting with enhanced security, reliability, and monitoring capabilities.
